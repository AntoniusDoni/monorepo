### Using Authentication in Swagger UI
1. First, use the `/login` endpoint to get a JWT token
2. Click the **"Authorize"** button (ðŸ”’) at the top of the Swagger UI
3. In the "BearerAuth" field, enter: `Bearer <your-jwt-token>`
   - Example: `Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`
4. Click **"Authorize"** to apply the token
5. Now you can test all protected endpoints directly in the UI

**Note:** The token will be automatically included in the Authorization header for all subsequent API calls.

## Authentication Endpoints

## Error Responses

```

## Common HTTP Status Codes

- `200 OK`: Request successful
- `201 Created`: Resource created successfully

- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid request data
- `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication required or invalid token
- `404 Not Found`: Resource not found
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Server error

## Authentication

Most endpoints require JWT authentication. Include the token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
```

### Getting Started with Authentication
1. **Register a new office and user**: Use `POST /register-with-office` for initial setup
2. **Login**: Use `POST /login` with your credentials to get a JWT token
3. **Use the token**: Include it in the Authorization header for all subsequent requests

## User Roles

### Admin Role
- Automatically assigned to all newly registered users
- Has access to all API endpoints
- Can manage offices, warehouses, and other resources

**Note:** Currently, all users are assigned the "admin" role upon registration. Future versions may include role-based access control with different permission levels.

## Validation Rules

### User Registration
- Username: 3-50 characters
- Password: Minimum 6 characters
- Email: Valid email format
- Office ID: Valid UUID format

### Office Creation
- Code: 2-10 characters, unique
- Name: 3-100 characters
- Address, City, Phone: Optional fields

## Environment Setup

To enable the warehouse module (including offices), set:
```
ENABLE_MODULES=warehouse
```

## Development

To regenerate Swagger documentation:
```bash
swag init -g apps/main.go -o docs --parseDependency --parseInternal
```

## Testing the API

### Quick Start Example
1. **Create office and user**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/register-with-office \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "username": "admin",
       "password": "password123",
       "email": "admin@company.com",
       "office_code": "HQ01",
       "office_name": "Headquarters",
       "office_address": "123 Business St",
       "office_city": "New York"
     }'
   ```

2. **Login to get token**:
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/login \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "username": "admin",
       "password": "password123"
     }'
   ```

3. **Use token to access protected endpoints**:
   ```bash
   curl -X GET http://localhost:8080/v1/api/offices \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN_HERE"
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"user has no roles assigned" error during login**:
   - This should no longer occur as users are automatically assigned the admin role
   - If it persists, check that the seeder has run and the admin role exists

2. **401 Unauthorized errors**:
   - Ensure the JWT token is properly formatted: `Bearer <token>`
   - Check that the token hasn't expired
   - Verify the user has the required role

3. **Office creation fails**:
   - Check that the office code is unique
   - Ensure all required fields are provided
